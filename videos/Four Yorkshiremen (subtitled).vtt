WEBVTT

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.420
very possible is very possible.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.560
A good glass of Chateau of CHS are just sir.

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:11.720
Oh,

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:12.569
you're right there.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:12.619
Over.

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:13.609
Aye.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:18.549
Who would have thought 30 years ago we'd all be sitting here drinking

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:19.500
Chateau de Chasse?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.809
Them days We're glad to have the price of a cup of tea?

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:24.069
Aye.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.120
A cup of cold tea without milk or sugar or tea

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:30.829
in a cracked cup and all.

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.510
Oh,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.869
we never used to have a cup.

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:36.000
We used to have to drink out of a roll of newspaper.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.630
The best we could manage was to suck on a piece of damp cloth.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.919
But,

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.590
you know,

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:42.069
we were happy in those days.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.470
Although we were poor because we were poor.

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.840
Aye.

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:46.479
My old dad used to say to me,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.729
Money doesn't bring you happiness,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.130
son.

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:49.029
It was right.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.389
I was happier then and I had nothing.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.720
We used to live in this tiny old tumble down house with great big holes in the

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.029
roof and house.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.590
You were lucky to live in a house.

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:01.020
We used to live in one room.

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:02.090
All 26 of us.

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.909
No furniture.

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:04.010
Half the floor was missing.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.870
We were all huddled together in one corner for fear of falling.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:09.279
You were lucky to have a room.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.040
We used to have to live in the corridor.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.720
Oh,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.389
we used to dream of living in a corridor would have been a

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.360
palace to us.

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:20.750
We used to live in an old water tank on a rubbish tip.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.730
We all woke up every morning by having a load of rotten fish dogged all over us

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.150
House.

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:27.209
Uh,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.190
well,

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:29.120
when I say house,

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:32.540
it was just a hole in the ground covered by a sheet of tarpaulin.

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:34.540
But it was a house to us.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.139
We were evicted from our hole in the ground.

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.139
We had to go and live in a lake.

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:43.279
You were lucky to have a lake.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.300
There were 100 and 50 of us living in a shoe box in the middle of the road.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.540
Cardboard box A.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.589
You were looking.

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:56.720
We lived for three months in a rolled up newspaper and a septic tank.

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.110
We just have to get up every morning at six o'clock and clean the newspaper,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.430
go to work down the mill 14 hours a day,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.129
week in week,

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:05.500
out for sixpence a week.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.819
And when we got home,

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.800
our dad was trash us to sleep with his belt luxury.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.089
We used to have to get out of the lake at three o'clock in the morning.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.949
Clean the lake,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.259
eat a handful of gravel,

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.080
work 20 hours a day at Milford Twopence.

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.720
A month come home.

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:24.369
And Dad would beat us around the head and neck with a broken bottle if we were lucky.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.990
Well,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.309
of course we had it tough.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.619
We used to have to get them out of the shoe box in the middle of the night and lick the road clean with our

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.350
tonnes.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.970
We had to eat half a handful of freezing cold gravel.

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.149
Worked 24 hours of that mill for performance every six years.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.350
And when we got home,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.759
our dad would slice into it with a bread knife,

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:46.779
Right.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.250
I had to get up in the morning at 10 o'clock at night,

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:51.779
half an hour before I went to bed,

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.220
eat a lump of coal poison,

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.979
work 29 hours a day down mill and pay me honour for permission to come to work.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.179
And when we got home,

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.600
our dad would kill us and dance about in our grave singing Hallelujah!

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.750
And you try and tell the young people of today that and they won't believe you.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.160
No,

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:10.619
they won't.
